DSChess
=====
The platform for DS Project 2.

## AI API
All ai for this game should implement *com.sweetdum.dschess.ai.ChessAI*.
All methods of this interface would receive an instance of *com.sweetdum.dschess.game.GameControllerAdapter*, which 
could be used to access the chess board.

Refer to the Javadoc of *GameControllerAdapter* for more details.

The GUI of this platform is coming soon.
